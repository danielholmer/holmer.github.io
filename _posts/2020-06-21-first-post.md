Finishing my bachelor and going into my masters degree, I felt like I needed a place to share my ongoing projects.
I've made earlier attempts [^1] at creating a personal website, which never really got completed. When I stumbled upon the Ruby-based [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), I decided to give it another shot.

So: this is a place where I will share the things I am currently working on. I hope you will enjoy it!
